If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
   We know the average energy, valence, and danceability of Spotify's top 100 songs of 2018.
   So we can compare the average to the average of a listener's top 100 songs.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    Dividing emotions into six categories sounds plausible, but it's not accurate.
    More points and more weights will be more accurate than two.
