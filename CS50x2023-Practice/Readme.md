# Notice

This repository is a CS50x2023-CS50x2023-Harvard-University exercise set and experimental summary repository for the convenience of rabbits who love to learn without tools. If you have tools, it is recommended to go to the official website address to learn: <https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/>.

## How to use the files in the cs50 folder to test your own code in the local VSCode environment

You need to include cs50.c cs50.h in your folder and compile both files together on command line :

```
example: gcc -o hello hello.c cs50.c
```

## Suggestion

> A quick word on Academic Honesty. While these solutions will help you to get through the course without too much effort, you should do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a look at any of my solutions. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.

> Here, I hope to establish a discussion area for learning. If you have any questions about a certain exercise, you are welcome to ask through `issues` at any time, and I and we will answer them.
