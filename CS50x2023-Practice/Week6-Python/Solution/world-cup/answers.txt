Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
The rating and the chance of winning are not proportional with a small number of simulations.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.

After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
